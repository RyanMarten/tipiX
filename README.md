tipiX - time picture explorer is an experimental tool for exploring time (or other dimensions) of image sets, generally images from similar view points (e.g. frames from timelapses). 
Take a test drive by trying an example dataset or load your own. Once loaded, movement with the mouse along x or y can explore difference dimensions of the data.
