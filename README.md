tipiX
=====

tipiX - time picture explorer is an experimental tool for exploring time (or other dimensions) of image sets, generally images from similar view points (e.g. frames from timelapses). 
Take a test drive by trying an example dataset or load your own. Once loaded, movement with the mouse along x or y can explore difference dimensions of the data.

TODOs:
------
- maintain a separate page with *many* of my own datasets.
-- Add some information about the original images (Camera Make, Total Count, ETC)
- change of set should really clear all variables, etc.
- clean-up css
- put images in preview div as they load
- do youtube-style tutorial
