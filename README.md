tipiX
=====

tipiX - time picture explorer is an experimental tool for exploring time (or other dimensions) of image sets, generally images from similar view points (e.g. frames from timelapses). 
Take a test drive by trying an example dataset or load your own. Once loaded, movement with the mouse along x or y can explore difference dimensions of the data.

Use:
----
1. Load a dataset (see instructions under 'load' tab)
2. Move mouse over image to switch between images
